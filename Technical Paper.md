# Technical Paper

## 1. What are the 4 principles of OOPS?

The four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods together inside a class. Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details from the user. Inheritance allows one class to use properties of another class. Polymorphism allows the same method to behave differently in different situations.

## 2. What are loops in Python?

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python mainly has two types of loops: `for` loop and `while` loop. A `for` loop is used when we know how many times we want to repeat something. A `while` loop runs as long as a condition is true.

## 3. What is Snake Case?

Snake case is a naming style where words are written in lowercase and separated by underscores. For example: `my_variable_name`. It is commonly used in Python for variable and function names.

## 4. What are data types?

Data types define the type of value a variable can store. In Python, common data types are `int` (integer), `float` (decimal numbers), `str` (string), `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dict`. Data types help Python understand how to store and use the data.

## 5. What is the difference between class variable and instance variable?

A class variable is shared by all objects of a class. An instance variable is specific to each object. Class variables are defined inside the class but outside methods, while instance variables are usually defined inside the constructor using `self`.

## 6. What is the remove command in CLI?

In Linux, the `rm` command is used to remove files. For example, `rm filename.txt` deletes a file. It permanently deletes files, so it should be used carefully.

## 7. What are mutable and immutable objects?

Mutable objects can be changed after they are created, like lists and dictionaries. Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation, like strings, integers, and tuples. If we try to change an immutable object, Python creates a new object instead.

## 8. What is the use of -r for removing directories?

The `-r` option with the `rm` command stands for recursive. It is used to delete directories and all the files and subdirectories inside them. Example: `rm -r foldername`.

## 9. What is a dictionary in Python?

A dictionary is a data type that stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access its value. Dictionaries are written using curly braces `{}`. Example: `{"name": "John", "age": 20}`.

## 10. What are break and continue in Python?

`break` is used to stop a loop immediately. When Python sees `break`, it exits the loop. `continue` is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next one without stopping the loop.

## 11. What is the difference between a method and a class?

A class is a blueprint used to create objects. A method is a function defined inside a class that describes the behavior of the object. Classes define structure, while methods define actions.

## 12. What is the ls command and its flags?

The `ls` command is used to list files and directories in Linux. Some common flags are `-l` for long format (shows details), `-a` to show hidden files, and `-h` to show file sizes in a readable format.

## 13. Why is input in Python a string type?

In Python, the `input()` function always returns data as a string by default. This is because user input is treated as text. If we want a number, we need to convert it using `int()` or `float()`.

## 14. How to delete the last item in a dictionary?

We can delete the last inserted item in a dictionary using the `popitem()` method. It removes and returns the last key-value pair. Example: `my_dict.popitem()`.

## 15. What is a list in Python?

A list is a collection data type that can store multiple values in a single variable. Lists are ordered and mutable, which means we can change their elements. Lists are written using square brackets `[]`.


## 16. What is Git status?

`git status` is a command used in Git to check the current state of your working directory and repository. It shows which files are modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are not being tracked by Git. This command helps you understand what changes are ready to be committed and what still needs attention before committing.
